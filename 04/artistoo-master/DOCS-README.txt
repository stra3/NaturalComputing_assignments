*	To change the headers of the autogenerated page: adjust the layout file 
	in the mytemplate folder. The contents of this file are used to build all auto-
	generated docs and manual files.
	
*	When building the manual, even pages written in html get converted by the
	esdoc-publish-html-plugin. Unfortunately, this plugin has limited knowledge
	of HTML tags and escapes too much of the code. This happens in the script
	node_modules/esdoc-publish-html-plugin/out/src/Builder/util.js, in the function
	'markdown'. This function contains a variable availableTags that can be modified
	to add other html tags that should not be escaped.
