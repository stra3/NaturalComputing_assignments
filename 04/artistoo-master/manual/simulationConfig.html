<h1 id="configuring-simulations-1">Configuring Simulations (1)</h1>

<p>
Once you have written a <a href="./quickstart.html">fist simulation</a>, you can 
adapt it by modifying parameters, 
or you can increase the number of cells in your simulation and examine 
interactions between different cell types.</p>

<p>The <a href="../class/src/simulation/Simulation.js~Simulation.html">Simulation class</a>
allows you to make many of those changes by simply modifying the its
<a href="./quickstart.html#step-1---configure-the-cpm--amp--simulation">configuration object</a>, 
which will be the topic of this tutorial. 
The next tutorial will show you how you can make even more advanced simulations 
by writing custom functions - but for now we will focus on changes you can make
through configuration only.</p>


<p>We will start from this very simple simulation from the 
<a href="./quickstart.html">previous tutorial</a>:

<div>
<iframe src="./manual/asset/SingleCell.html" width="350px" height="400px"> </iframe>
</div>

<p>
This tutorial assumes you have completed the previous tutorial, and we will 
examine the <code>config</code> object of the simulation you generated there in more detail:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">let config = {

	// Grid settings
	field_size : [100,100],
	
	// CPM parameters and configuration
	conf : {
		T : 20,								// CPM temperature
				
		// Adhesion parameters:
		J: [[0,20], [20,100]] ,
		
		// VolumeConstraint parameters
		LAMBDA_V : [0,50],				// VolumeConstraint importance per cellkind
		V : [0,500]						// Target volume of each cellkind
	},
	
	// Simulation setup and configuration
	simsettings : {
		// Cells on the grid
		NRCELLS : [1],					// Number of cells to seed for all
										// non-background cellkinds.

        RUNTIME : 500,                  // Only used in node

		CANVASCOLOR : "eaecef",
		zoom : 4						// zoom in on canvas with this factor.
	}
}</code></code></pre>

<p>We will now see how changes to this object can alter the simulation.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-the-cpm-itself">Configuring the CPM itself</h3>

<p>First, let's see how we can control the <a href="../class/src/models/CPM.js~CPM.html">
CPM model class</a> itself. For this lesson, we recommend you start from the HTML version 
of the simulation in the <a href="./quickstart.html">previous tutorial</a>.
This HTML version will allow you to
see the effect of your changes more quickly than running a node script would.</p>


<h4 id="changing-cpm-parameters">Changing CPM parameters</h4>

<p>As we've seen before, the <code>config</code> object has three parts: the 
<code>field_size</code>, the <code>conf</code>, and the <code>simsettings</code>. 
We will now look at the <code>conf</code> part, which controls the CPM model itself.</p>


<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">// CPM parameters and configuration
	conf : {
		T : 20,								// CPM temperature
				
		// Adhesion parameters:
		J: [[0,20], [20,100]] ,
		
		// VolumeConstraint parameters
		LAMBDA_V : [0,50],				// VolumeConstraint importance per cellkind
		V : [0,500]						// Target volume of each cellkind
	},</code></code></pre>

<p>The CPM shown here has only two constraints: the 
<a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/Adhesion.js~Adhesion.html">Adhesion</a> and
<a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/VolumeConstraint.js~VolumeConstraint.html">Volume</a>
constraints. The <code>T</code> parameter belongs to the CPM itself and controls to
what extent the model "listens" to the energy rules it gets. The higher T, the more likely
the model is to misbehave. But if T is too low, the cell might get stuck in a state it
can't get out of.
</p>

<b>Exercise</b> : 

<i>Try some different values for T here, and see what happens with your simulation.</i>

<p>The other parameters here belong to the constraints. The <code>J</code> values form
a matrix controlling the adhesion between cell and background. The $J_{00}$ value, which
is here 0, is never used (the adhesion constraint only counts adhesion between pixels
belonging to different cells, and since there is only one background "cell", there can
be no background-background adhesion). The $J_{01}$ and $J_{10}$ values (here 20) are
the adhesion between cell and background, and are important for this simulation. 
The $J_{11}$ would be the adhesion between two different cells and is also not relevant
yet, since there is only one cell.</p>

<p>The <code>V</code> and <code>LAMBDA_V</code> parameters control the volume constraint,
see its <a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/VolumeConstraint.js~VolumeConstraint.html">documentation</a>. </p>


<b>Exercises</b> : 

<ol>
<li><i>Change the values in <code>J</code>, and try to make the cell fall apart. Do you
understand why this happens?</i></li>
<li><i>How would you make the cell twice as big? Try it.<i></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, note that we can also add more different constraints to the model via the
<code>conf</code> object. We'll do that in a later tutorial.</p>


<h4 id="setting-a-random-seed">Setting a random seed</h4>

<p>If you look at the simulation on the top of this page and then refresh a few times, 
you should see that every simulation "run" goes a little differently. This happens because
the CPM is stochastic. If you don't want this, because you want someone else to be able
to reproduce exactly your results, you can try setting a random <code>seed</code>:</p>


<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">// CPM parameters and configuration
	conf : {
		T : 20,								// CPM temperature
		seed : 1,
				
		// Adhesion parameters:
		J: [[0,20], [20,100]] ,
		
		// VolumeConstraint parameters
		LAMBDA_V : [0,50],				// VolumeConstraint importance per cellkind
		V : [0,500]						// Target volume of each cellkind
	},</code></code></pre>


<b>Exercise</b> :

<i>Set a random seed in your simulation's HTML file. Refresh the page a few times
and look what happens. What is different now?</i>


<h3 id="configuring-the-grid"> Configuring the grid</h3>

<h4 id="field-size"> Field size </h4>

<p>Open your file <code>MyFirstSimulation.html</code> from the previous tutorial in the web
browser. You should see a black cell floating inside a square gray area, which
is the field or "grid" the simulation runs in.</p>

<p> The size of this grid is controlled by <code>field_size</code> in the <code>config</code> 
object. The entry </p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">// Grid settings
field_size : [100,100],</code></code></pre>


<p>
ensures that the simulation is performed on a 100 x 100 pixel (2D) grid. We can change 
the size of this grid by changing the numbers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> between
the square brackets: <code>[x,y]</code>, where <code>x</code> controls the grid's width 
and <code>y</code> controls its height. For example, changing this setting to:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">	// Grid settings
	field_size : [150,100], </code></code></pre>


<p>makes the grid slightly broader, but equally high as before.</p>

<b>Exercise</b> : 

<i>How would you make a grid with a width of 100 pixels and a
height of 200 pixels? Open your file</i> <code>MyFirstSimulation.html</code> <i>in your 
favourite text editor, change the</i> <code>field_size</code> <i>in the appropriate manner, 
and save the file. Now open</i> <code>MyFirstSimulation.html</code> <i>in your web browser 
(or just refresh the page if you had already done so). Did it work?</i>


<h4 id="grid-boundaries"> Grid boundaries</h4>

<p>Have a look at the following simulation:</p>

<div>
<iframe src="./manual/asset/ActSmall.html" width="350px" height="300px"> </iframe>
</div>

<p> When the cell leaves the grid on the right, we see that it re-enters on the left.
We call this a grid with <i>periodic boundaries</i>. Because grid boundaries are linked,
the cell feels as though it is roaming an infinite space.</p>

<p>In the <code>CPM</code> object, the grid boundary conditions can be set through the
<code>torus</code> property in the configuration object like this:</p>


<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">// CPM parameters and configuration
	conf : {
		T : 20,								// CPM temperature
		torus : [true,true],
				
		// Adhesion parameters:
		J: [[0,20], [20,100]] ,
		
		// VolumeConstraint parameters
		LAMBDA_V : [0,50],				// VolumeConstraint importance per cellkind
		V : [0,500]						// Target volume of each cellkind
	},</code></code></pre>

<p>When <code>torus=true</code>, this means that the grid boundaries are linked as in the
example above (this is also the default when we don't supply the <code>torus</code>
property in the configuration settings). If we don't want linked boundaries, we can
change this value to false:</p>



<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">// CPM parameters and configuration
	conf : {
		T : 20,								// CPM temperature
		torus : [false,false],
				
		// Adhesion parameters:
		J: [[0,20], [20,100]] ,
		
		// VolumeConstraint parameters
		LAMBDA_V : [0,50],				// VolumeConstraint importance per cellkind
		V : [0,500]						// Target volume of each cellkind
	},</code></code></pre>

<p>However, what we get is not quite what we intended: </p>

<div>
<iframe src="./manual/asset/ActSmall2.html" width="350px" height="300px"> </iframe>
</div>

<p>The problem here is that we can't just say that there are boundaries without telling
the CPM how to deal with those boundaries. A pixel at the border of the grid will have 
fewer neighboring pixels to contribute to its 
<a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/Adhesion.js~Adhesion.html">adhesion</a> or 
<a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/PerimeterConstraint.js~PerimeterConstraint.html">surface</a>
energy, which will give artefacts. In reality, any physical boundary a cell might
encounter <i>would</i> contribute to adhesion energy.</p>

<p>To solve such problems, it is possible to create a layer of boundary pixels at the
edges of the grid, to which the adhesion can be explicitly defined. See
<a href="../examples/NoTorusDemo.html">this example</a> for details and implementation (once you see the simulation,
right click on the page (outside of the simulation grid) and select "view page source" 
to see code).</p>



<h3 id="configuring-the-simulation-object">Configuring the Simulation object </h3>

<p>The <a href="../class/src/simulation/Simulation.js~Simulation.html">Simulation object</a> 
automatically takes care of many aspects of the
simulation, such as seeding cells on the grid, running the simulation for a number of 
steps, drawing the output images and computing output statistics. We'll discuss how to
tune some of these aspects here.</p>

<p>Have a look at the documentation for the <code>constructor</code> of the simulation
class <a href="../class/src/simulation/Simulation.js~Simulation.html#instance-constructor-constructor">here</a>. 
All the options listed under <code>simsettings</code> here are options to configure the 
simulation, which we will discuss here.</p>

<h4 id="controlling-the-simulation">Controlling the simulation</h4>

<p>Using the option <code>NRCELLS</code>, we can specify how many cells of each 
<a href="../typedef/index.html#static-typedef-CellKind">CellKind</a> we want to seed
on the grid at the beginning of the simulation. Note that this needs to be an array with
one element for each non-background cellkind on the grid. This means this array is one
element shorter than most typical CPM parameters (e.g. <code>LAMBDA_V</code>) which are
specified for each cellkind <i>including</i> background. If the lengths of these 
different arrays are not consistent with each other, the CPM will get confused about
how many cellkinds you want on the grid. It will crash.</p>

<p>By default, the simulation class seeds them in random positions. We'll discuss how 
to seed cells in more customized locations in a later tutorial. But for now, try 
modifying the <code>NRCELLS</code> property of your simulation and see what happens.</p>


<p>The <code>RUNTIME</code> property determines for how many Monte Carlo Steps (MCS) the
simulation will run. This property is actually only used by node simulations. 
You can use the <code>RUNTIME_BROWSER</code> property in the browser, but then you must
use that in your <code>step()</code> function like this: </p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">function step(){
	sim.step()
	meter.tick()
	if( sim.conf["RUNTIME_BROWSER"] == "Inf" | sim.time+1 < sim.conf["RUNTIME_BROWSER"] ){
		requestAnimationFrame( step )
	}
}</code></code></pre>

<p>This way, the simulation will only keep running until <code>RUNTIME_BROWSER</code> is
reached. If we wouldn't do this, the browser simulation would just keep running infinitely
(or in practice, until your patience or your computer's battery runs out and you close 
the browser window).</p>


<h4 id="controlling-the-visualization">Controlling the visualization</h4>

<p>The Simulation class contains a default method 
<a href="../file/src/simulation/Simulation.js.html#lineNumber210"><code>drawCanvas()</code></a>
that takes care of drawing the grid for you. You can control the way this function draws
the grid via the <code>simsettings</code> object as well, by setting: </p>

<ul>
	<li><code>CANVASCOLOR</code>, the color code to draw the background in. If left
	unspecified, this is white (<code>"FFFFFF""</code>).</li>
	<li><code>CELLCOLOR</code>, the color code to draw the cells in. If left
	unspecified, this is black (<code>"000000""</code>). If you do wish to specify it,
	you must provide an array with a color for each <a href="../typedef/index.html#static-typedef-CellKind">CellKind</a>
	just like we did for NRCELLS above. E.g. for one black and one red cell kind, that would
	be <code>["000000","FF0000"]</code></li>
	<li><code>ACTCOLOR</code>, whether or not to draw the activity gradient if the cells
	have an <a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/ActivityConstraint.js~ActivityConstraint.html">
	ActivityConstraint</a>. If left unspecified, this is set to <code>false</code> for 
	each <a href="../typedef/index.html#static-typedef-CellKind">CellKind</a>. </li>
	<li><code>SHOWBORDERS</code>, whether or not to draw the borders of each cell as well
	as their area. This is <code>false</code> by default.</li>
	<li><code>BORDERCOL</code>, the color to draw the cell borders in, once more specified
	for each <a href="../typedef/index.html#static-typedef-CellKind">CellKind</a>. This
	is only used whenever <code>SHOWBORDERS</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</li>
	<li><code>zoom</code>the factor by which to enlarge the image (note that using a higher
	zoom factor may slow down your simulation, since it takes more time to draw the grid
	in a larger image. If a simulation is fast enough, this won't be an issue, but if
	you notice your simulations being too slow you might want to adjust this factor).</li>
</ul>

<p>For all the options involving color, this online <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker">
color picker</a> may come in handy.</p>


<b>Exercise</b> :

<i>Given all the information we have covered so far, can you reproduce a simulation that 
looks roughly like the one below?</i>


<div>
<iframe src="./manual/asset/ColorEx.html" width="450px" height="450px"> </iframe>
</div>



<h4 id="controlling-outputs">Controlling outputs</h4>

<p>The simulation class helps you by generating outputs automatically. This happens inside
the function <a href="../file/src/simulation/Simulation.js.html#lineNumber328"><code>createOutputs()</code></a>, 
which does two things:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Drawing things on the screen (browser version) or on an output PNG image (node version)</li>
	<li>Computing and logging statistics to the console (both versions)</li>
</ol>

<p>In node, you can control the following aspects of the PNG images that are written:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>SAVEIMG</code>, are any images saved at all? Defaults to <code>false</code>;</li>
	<li><code>IMGFRAMERATE</code>, how often should an image be saved? Defaults to 
		<code>1</code> (save an image every simulation step), but you might set it to e.g.
		<code>10</code> to save an image only once every 10 steps. This may significantly
		speed up your simulations since drawing images can be a speed bottleneck. Very often,
		drawing every step is not necessary to get a smooth movie in the end;</li>
	<li><code>SAVEPATH</code>, in which folder should images be stored? You have to make 
		sure this folder exists, or you will get an error. Although this option is documented
		as "optional", this is only true because you don't have to give it when 
		<code>SAVEIMG=false</code>. If you set <code>SAVEIMG=true</code>, you must provide this
		option.</li>
	<li><code>EXPNAME</code>, a name used to generate the name of the output images. These
		will be stored as <code>[SAVEPATH]/[EXPNAME]-t[STEP].png</code>. Defaults to
		<code>"mysim"</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the options above only apply to node, since the browser version does not support
writing PNG images. If you want to make a movie from the browser version, just record your
screen. If you wish to change the <code>IMGFRAMERATE</code> of your browser simulation,
you can adjust your <code>step()</code> function (see also <a href="./quickstart.html">
this tutorial</a>) to something like this:

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">function step(){
	// Run IMGFRAMERATE simulation steps before rendering
	for( let s = 0; s < config.simsettings.IMGFRAMERATE; s++ ){
		sim.step()
	}
	requestAnimationFrame( step )
}</code></code></pre>

<p>Note that <a href="../class/src/simulation/Simulation.js~Simulation.html#instance-method-step">
<code>sim.step()</code></a> will still call 
<a href="../class/src/simulation/Simulation.js~Simulation.html#instance-method-drawCanvas">
<code>drawCanvas()</code></a> every 
step, but the grid will only be <i>rendered</i> once every <code>IMGFRAMERATE</code>
steps. Since rendering is often the bottleneck, this will still speed up your simulation
most of the times.</p>

<p>The <a href="../file/src/simulation/Simulation.js.html#lineNumber328"><code>createOutputs()</code></a>
also takes care of logging statistics to the console. By default, it logs the simulation
step, the <a href="../typedef/index.html#static-typedef-CellId">cellID</a>, the
<a href="../typedef/index.html#static-typedef-CellKind">CellKind</a>, and the centroid
of every cell on the grid. To adjust this, you can overwrite this method, which we will
discuss in a later tutorial.</p>

<p>Two settings in the <code>simsettings</code> object control the logging of statistics:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>LOGSTATS</code>, specifying for browser and node separately whether statistics
	should be logged to the console. Defaults to <code>{ browser: false, node: true }<code>;</li>
	<li><code>LOGRATE</code>, specifying how often statistics are computed and logged. Defaults to 
		<code>1</code> (log every simulation step), but you might set it to e.g.
		<code>10</code> to log only once every 10 steps.</li>
</ul>
